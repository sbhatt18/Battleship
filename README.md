# Battleship
Battleship is an RPG / Text based recreation of the ever popular board-game 'Battleship', where the goal of each player is to successfully sink the opponent's battleships. If your score is high enough you might get promoted as a Captain from a Lieutenant.This game is only text based and can run on an CMD prompt window or in an IDE Terminal. It does not have a GUI but, in the future I might add it. This program incorporates many Obj. Oriented Programming technics such as multiple classes, encapsulation and polymorphism. Runtime complexity and multiple edge cases have also been considered for optimal efficiency. Comments have been used for documentation and debugging purposes.
